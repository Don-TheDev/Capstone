889;Season 1;lord snow;I hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in Kings Landing But something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels Half the boys youve seen training will die north of the Wall Might be a wildings axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold They die in pain And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort;benjen;3;3;01/05/2011

894;Season 1;lord snow;But I dont believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it;tyrion;3;3;01/05/2011
895;Season 1;lord snow;Youre right The wildlings are no different from us A little rougher maybe But theyre made of meat and bone I know how to track them and I know how to kill them Its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights Youve never been north of the Wall, so dont tell me whats out there;benjen;3;3;01/05/2011

13380;Season 4;mockingbird;Most of these powders and potions are lies Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lords power Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was a trick that lead them to the truth A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear And a drop of this in any mans wine will drive him wild with lust;melisandre;37;7;18/05/2014

13407;Season 4;mockingbird;That is why Ive ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai The masters tear babies from their mothers arms They mutilate little boys by the thousands They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself;daenerys;37;7;18/05/2014
13408;Season 4;mockingbird;Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts The slaves you freed, brutality is all theyve ever known If you want them to know something else, youll have to show it to them;jorah;37;7;18/05/2014

16793;Season 5;hardhome;To see if you were the right kind of terrible;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16794;Season 5;hardhome;Which kind is that?;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16795;Season 5;hardhome;The kind that prevents your people from being even more so;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16796;Season 5;hardhome;I did reopen the fighting pits Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16797;Season 5;hardhome;Yes, that was wise And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good Very impressive My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid She ended up having him killed;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16798;Season 5;hardhome;Perhaps it won’t come to that;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16799;Season 5;hardhome;It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16800;Season 5;hardhome;Varys? King Robert’s spy master?;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16801;Season 5;hardhome;Yes He was the one who convinced me to come find you He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16802;Season 5;hardhome;Jorah sent my secrets to Varys For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16803;Season 5;hardhome;He did what he had to do to survive He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16804;Season 5;hardhome;But you trust him?;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16805;Season 5;hardhome;Yes, oddly He might be the only person in the world that I trust Besides my brother;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16806;Season 5;hardhome;The brother who killed my father;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16807;Season 5;hardhome;That’s the one;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16808;Season 5;hardhome;Perhaps I will have you killed after all;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16809;Season 5;hardhome;Your queenly prerogative I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015

16821;Season 5;hardhome;And when you get back to your home, who supports you?;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16822;Season 5;hardhome;The common people;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015
16823;Season 5;hardhome;Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours That leaves the Tyrells Not impossible, but not enough;tyrion;48;8;31/05/2015
16824;Season 5;hardhome;Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell They’re all just spokes on a wheel This ones on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground;daenerys;48;8;31/05/2015

19831;Season 6;no one;I prefer chicken;sandor;58;8;12/06/2016
19832;Season 6;no one;You ought to join us We could use you;beric;58;8;12/06/2016
19833;Season 6;no one;I tried joining Didn’t work out for me;sandor;58;8;12/06/2016
19834;Season 6;no one;Clegane, we’re here for a reason The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason We are part of something larger than ourselves;thoros;58;8;12/06/2016
19835;Season 6;no one;Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves;sandor;58;8;12/06/2016

19838;Season 6;no one;We need good men to help us;beric;58;8;12/06/2016
19839;Season 6;no one;Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me;sandor;58;8;12/06/2016
19840;Season 6;no one;True enough But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me Why?;beric;58;8;12/06/2016
19841;Season 6;no one;I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now;sandor;58;8;12/06/2016
19842;Season 6;no one;Aye, you’re probably right You’re a fighter You were born a fighter You walked away from the fight How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you;beric;58;8;12/06/2016

19844;Season 6;no one;Lady Crane?;arya;58;8;12/06/2016
19845;Season 6;no one;If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly;waif;58;8;12/06/2016
19846;Season 6;no one;Instead;waif;58;8;12/06/2016
19847;Season 6;no one;The Many-Faced God was promised a name He must always receive what is his You can’t change that I can’t change that No one can And now he’s been promised another name;waif;58;8;12/06/2016

19849;Season 6;no one;Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you;waif;58;8;12/06/2016
19850;Season 6;no one;You told her to kill me;arya;58;8;12/06/2016
19851;Season 6;no one;Yes But here you are And there she is;jaqen;58;8;12/06/2016
19852;Season 6;no one;Finally a girl is no one;jaqen;58;8;12/06/2016
19853;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19854;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Perhaps we should take shelter;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19855;Season 6;battle of the bastards;The city is on the rise?;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19856;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Meereen is strong Commerce has returned to the markets The people are behind you;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19857;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Well, not all the people, of course No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19858;Season 6;battle of the bastards;it proves that no one needs a Master;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19859;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Good Shall we begin?;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19860;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Do we have a plan?;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19861;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I will crucify the Masters I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt That is my plan;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19862;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You don’t approve?;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19863;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You once told me you knew what your father was Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19864;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Probably not Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares He would have burned every one of his citizens The loyal ones and the trators Every man, woman, and child That’s why Jaime killed him;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19865;Season 6;battle of the bastards;This is entirely different;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19866;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’re talking about destroying cities It’s not entirely different I’d like to suggest an alternate approach;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19867;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Once before, I offered you peace If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are;razdal;59;9;19/06/2016
19868;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19869;Season 6;battle of the bastards;The terms are simple You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered;yezzan;59;9;19/06/2016
19870;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We obviously didn’t communicate clearly We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19871;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality Your reign is over;razdal;59;9;19/06/2016
19872;Season 6;battle of the bastards;My reign has just begun;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19873;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Dracarys;daenerys;59;9;19/06/2016
19874;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You men have a choice;grey worm;59;9;19/06/2016
19875;Season 6;battle of the bastards;fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families;grey worm;59;9;19/06/2016
19876;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Thank you for the armada Our queen does love ships Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact You violated that pact You declared war upon us Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19877;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes;missandei;59;9;19/06/2016
19878;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19879;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Him He should die;razdal;59;9;19/06/2016
19880;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Yes, him;belicho;59;9;19/06/2016
19881;Season 6;battle of the bastards;He’s not one of us He’s an outsider, a lowborn He does not speak for us;razdal;59;9;19/06/2016
19882;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Please;yezzan;59;9;19/06/2016
19883;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Tell your people what happened here Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19884;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You don’t have to be here;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19885;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Yes, I do;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19886;Season 6;battle of the bastards;My beloved wife I’ve missed you terribly;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19887;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle Get off your hose and kneel I’m a man of mercy;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19888;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’re right There’s no need for a battle Thousands of men don’t need to die Only one of us Let’s end this the old way You against me;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19889;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I keep hearing stories about you, bastard The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked Maybe you are that good Maybe not I don’t know if I’d beat you But I know that my army will beat yours I have 6,000 men You have, what, half that? Not even?;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19890;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Aye, you have the numbers Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19891;Season 6;battle of the bastards;He’s good Very good Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19892;Season 6;battle of the bastards;How do we know you have him?;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19893;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Now, if you want to save;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19894;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton Sleep well;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19895;Season 6;battle of the bastards;She’s a fine woman, your sister I look forward to having her back in my bed And you’re all fine-looking men My dogs are desperate to meet you I haven’t fed them for seven days They’re ravenous I wonder which parts they’ll try first Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough In the morning, then, bastard;ramsay;59;9;19/06/2016
19896;Season 6;battle of the bastards;If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19897;Season 6;battle of the bastards;That’s not his way He knows the North is watching If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him He can’t have that Fear is his power;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19898;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It’s his weakness, too His mean don’t want to fight for him They’re forced to fight for him If they feel the tide turning.;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19899;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It’s not his men that worry me It’s his horses I know what mounted knights can do to us;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19900;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19901;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We’re digging trenches all along our flanks They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment TORMUND stares blankly a;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19902;Season 6;battle of the bastards;A pincer move;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19903;Season 6;battle of the bastards;They won’t be able to hit us from the sides;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19904;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Good;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19905;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It’s crucial that we let them charge at us They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19906;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19907;Season 6;battle of the bastards;No But I wanted to make him angry I want him coming at us full tilt;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19908;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We should all get some sleep;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19909;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Rest, Jon Snow We need you sharp tomorrow;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19910;Season 6;battle of the bastards;So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19911;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Aye, for what they’re worth;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19912;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know I lived with him I know the way his mind works I know how he likes to hurt people Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19913;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’re right;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19914;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You think he’s going to fall into your trap He won’t He’s the one who lays traps;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19915;Season 6;battle of the bastards;He’s overconfident;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19916;Season 6;battle of the bastards;He plays with people He’s far better at it than you He’s been doing it all his life;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19917;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19918;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You don’t know him;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19919;Season 6;battle of the bastards;All right, tell me What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19920;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We’ll never get him back Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19921;Season 6;battle of the bastards;We can’t give up on our brother;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19922;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Listen to me, please He wants you to make a mistake;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19923;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Of course he does What should I do differently?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19924;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19925;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Aye, that’s good advice;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19926;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You think that’s obvious?;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19927;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Well, it is a bit obvious;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19928;Season 6;battle of the bastards;If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19929;Season 6;battle of the bastards;When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19930;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It’s not enough;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19931;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19932;Season 6;battle of the bastards;If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive Do you understand me? JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again I’ll protect you, I promise;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19933;Season 6;battle of the bastards;No one can protect me No one can protect anyone;sansa;59;9;19/06/2016
19934;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You think there’s hope?;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19935;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope You want to avenge your king, don’t you?;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19936;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis It was Stannis himself I loved the man He lifted me up and made me something But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19937;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You saw these demons?;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19938;Season 6;battle of the bastards;What?;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19939;Season 6;battle of the bastards;No, it’s a manner of speaking Not actual demons;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19940;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Oh Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned Mance didn’t have demons in his skull He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch I believed in him I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night But I was wrong just like you;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19941;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19942;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Jon Snow’s not a king;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19943;Season 6;battle of the bastards;No, he’s not;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19944;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19945;Season 6;battle of the bastards;No, thanks It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head I can never sleep the night before a battle;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19946;Season 6;battle of the bastards;So what do you do all night?;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19947;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I walk Think and walk Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out;davos;59;9;19/06/2016
19948;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Happy shitting;tormund;59;9;19/06/2016
19949;Season 6;battle of the bastards;My lady You weren’t at the war council;jon;59;9;19/06/2016

19954;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I’ll have to try;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19955;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I’m ordering you not to bring me back;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19956;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I am not your servant, Jon Snow;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19957;Season 6;battle of the bastards;You’re in my camp I’m the commander;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19958;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I serve the Lord of Light I do what he commands;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19959;Season 6;battle of the bastards;How do you know what he commands?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19960;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I interpret his signs as well as I can If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power Only what he gives me and he gave me you;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19961;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Why?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19962;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I don’t know Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else Maybe he brought you here to die again;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19963;Season 6;battle of the bastards;What kind of god would do something like that?;jon;59;9;19/06/2016
19964;Season 6;battle of the bastards;The one we’ve got;melisandre;59;9;19/06/2016
19965;Season 6;battle of the bastards;Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height The height of nobility,” a man of your stature,” someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19966;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It was a long time ago;theon;59;9;19/06/2016
19967;Season 6;battle of the bastards;It was And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well;tyrion;59;9;19/06/2016
19968;Season 6;battle of the bastards;I didn’t murder the Stark boys But I did things that were just as bad or worse;theon;59;9;19/06/2016

When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush The end is near! How will we survive? And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end But it wasnt None of it was The Wall has stood through it all And every winter that ever came has ended;marwyn;61;1;16/07/2017

20609;Season 7;stormborn;If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, hed have invaded Kings Landing already;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017

20619;Season 7;stormborn;But you didnt serve him long You turned against him;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017

Not with any king or queen, but with the people The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule The people whose hearts you aim to win If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me But if you let me live, I will serve you well I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you Because I know the people have no better chance than you;varys;62;2;23/07/2017

20644;Season 7;stormborn;She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne It didnt end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?;varys;62;2;23/07/2017
20645;Season 7;stormborn;No, it didnt;melisandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20646;Season 7;stormborn;You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20647;Season 7;stormborn;Weve just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20648;Season 7;stormborn;The Lord of Light doesnt have many followers in Westeros, does he?;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20649;Season 7;stormborn;Not yet But even those who dont worship the Lord can serve his cause;melisdandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20650;Season 7;stormborn;What does your Lord expect from me?;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20651;Season 7;stormborn;The Long Night is coming Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn;melisandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20652;Season 7;stormborn;The prince who was promised will bring the dawn Im afraid Im not a prince;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20653;Season 7;stormborn;Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn;missandei;62;2;23/07/2017
20654;Season 7;stormborn;Doesnt really roll off the tongue, does it?;tyrion;62;2;23/07/2017
20655;Season 7;stormborn;No, but I like it better;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20656;Season 7;stormborn;And you believe this prophecy refers to me?;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20657;Season 7;stormborn;Prophecies are dangerous things I believe you have a role to play, as does another ing in the North, Jon Snow;melisandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20658;Season 7;stormborn;Jon Snow? Ned Starks bastard?;tyrion;62;2;23/07/2017
20659;Season 7;stormborn;You know him?;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20660;Season 7;stormborn;I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Nights Watch;tyrion;62;2;23/07/2017
20661;Season 7;stormborn;And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions youve seen in the flames, that is?;varys;62;2;23/07/2017
20662;Season 7;stormborn;As Lord Commander of the Nights Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy;melisandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20663;Season 7;stormborn;He sounds like quite a man;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20664;Season 7;stormborn;Summon Jon Snow Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes;melisandre;62;2;23/07/2017
20665;Season 7;stormborn;I cant speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character;tyrion;62;2;23/07/2017
20666;Season 7;stormborn;If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do;tyrion;62;2;23/07/2017
20667;Season 7;stormborn;Very well Send a raven north Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone and bend the knee;daenerys;62;2;23/07/2017
20668;Season 7;stormborn;Do you think its really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap;sansa;62;2;23/07/2017

20673;Season 7;stormborn;Sounds like a charmer Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming;davos;62;2;23/07/2017

20681;Season 7;stormborn;You all remember the Mad King You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people His daughter is no different In Essos her brutality is already legendary She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slavers Bay And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons;cersei;62;2;23/07/2017

20985;Season 7;the queens justice;But you havent stormed Kings Landing Why not? The only reason I can see is you dont want to kill thousands of innocent people Its the fastest way to win the war but you wont do it Which means at the very least youre better than Cersei;jon;63;3;30/07/2017
20986;Season 7;the queens justice;Still, that doesnt explain why I need your help;daenerys;63;3;30/07/2017

I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib Not that it matters now of course I spent my life in foreign lands So many men have tried to kill me I dont remember all of their names I have been sold like a brood mare I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith Not in any gods Not in myths and legends In myself In Daenerys Targaryen The world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born The Dothraki hadnt crossed the sea Any sea;daenerys;63;3;30/07/2017

21010;Season 7;the queens justice;But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen He was named Lord Commander of the Nights Watch He was named King in the North Not because of his birthright He has no birthright Hes a damn bastard All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him;davos;63;3;30/07/2017
21011;Season 7;the queens justice;All those things you dont believe in, he faced those things He fought those things for the good of his people He risked his life for his people He took a knife in the heart for his people He gave his own -;davos;63;3;30/07/2017
